This is an simple implementation of the png specification done for learning purposes. I will consider regularly maintaining this if anyone takes interest. Just message me about it.

## Features
* implimented using only the standard library
* loading and saving of png images
* extracts png info from header and structures it
* allows for direct access of chunk data

## TODO Features
* allow various image manipulations
