This is an simple implementation of the png specification done for learning purposes. I will consider regularly maintaining this if anyone takes interest. Just message me about it and I'm sure we can work something out.

## Features
* implimented using only the standard library
* loading and saving of png images
* extracts png info from header and structures it
* allows for direct access of chunk bytes (does not compress or decompress them yet, you will have to implement that yourself for now)

## TODO Features
* INFLATE / DEFLATE Compression
* allow various image manipulations
